# Algorithms and Data Structures

This repo contains the assignments from Massey University course Algorithms and Data Structures 159.201

---
### Assignment 1

This Assignment reads in two sparse matrices and stores them as linked lists, and adds them together. Please see [Assignment 1 Outline](https://github.com/Lydia-Price776/Data_Structures/blob/main/Assignment1/Assignment1_Outline.pdf) for more information

---
### Assignment 2

This assignment evaluates a single Reverse Polish Notation expression using a stack. Please see [Assignment 2 Outline](https://github.com/Lydia-Price776/Data_Structures/blob/main/Assignment2/Assignment2_Outline.pdf) for more information

---
### Assignment 3

This assignment simulates traffic on an Internet router using Queues implemented by linked lists. Please see [Assignment 3
Outline](https://github.com/Lydia-Price776/Data_Structures/blob/main/Assignment3/Assignment3_Outline.pdf) for more information

---
### Assignment 4
This assignment implements addition on big numbers using linked lists. Please see [Assignment 4 Outline](https://github.com/Lydia-Price776/Data_Structures/blob/main/Assignment4/Assignment4_Outline.pdf) for more information


---
### Assignment 5
This assignment creates and populates a tree for an arithmetic expression. Then it performs in­order and post­order traversal on the tree. Please see [Assignment 5 Outline](https://github.com/Lydia-Price776/Data_Structures/blob/main/Assignment5/Assignment5_Outline.pdf) for more information

---
### Assignment 6
This assignment implements Dijkstra's algorithm and can find the minimum costs from node A to all other nodes. Please see [Assignment 6 Outline](https://github.com/Lydia-Price776/Data_Structures/blob/main/Assignment6/Assignment6_Outline.pdf) for more information

---
### Assignment 7
This assignment implements the Heap sort from 3 different vectors with random, reversed or sorted order. It also counts the number of comparisons when inserting elements in the Heap, and then when deleting elements from the Heap. The only comparisons counted are the ones that compare data directly. Please see [Assignment 7 Outline](https://github.com/Lydia-Price776/Data_Structures/blob/main/Assignment7/Assignment7_Outline.pdf) for more information
